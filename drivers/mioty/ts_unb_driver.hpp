1. INTRODUCTION

The Fraunhofer Telegram Splitting - Ultra Narrowband Library ("TS-UNB-Lib") is software
that implements only the uplink of the ETSI TS 103 357 TS-UNB standard ("MIOTY") for wireless 
data transmission in the field of IoT. Patent licenses for any patent claim regarding the 
ETSI TS 103 357 TS-UNB standard implementation (including those of Fraunhofer) may be 
obtained through Sisvel International S.A. 
(https://www.sisvel.com/licensing-programs/wireless-communications/mioty/license-terms)
or through the respective patent owners individually. The purpose of this TS-UNB-Lib is 
academic and non-commercial use. Therefore, Fraunhofer does not offer any support for the 
TS-UNB-Lib. Furthermore, the TS-UNB-Lib is NOT identical and on the same quality level as 
the commercially-licensed MIOTY software also available from Fraunhofer. Users are encouraged
to check the Fraunhofer website for additional applications information and documentation.
